# Election_Analysis

## **Project Overview:**
We were asked to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election needed by the Colorado Board of Editors.

The Python script would need to deliver the following info:

1. Total number of votes cast
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Winner of the election based on popular vote

## **Resources:**
* Data Source File: election_results.csv
* Software Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Basic 1.70.2 

## **Summary**

With the script developed, we can determine the following information from the election_results.csv file.

* *Total number of votes cast:* 369,711
* *Complete list of candidates:* Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doane
* *Total number of votes each candidate received and percentage:*
    * Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes (23.0% of votes)
    * Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes (73.8% of votes)
    * Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes (3.1% of votes)
* *Winner of the election*: **Diana DeGette**
