# Election_Analysis

## **Project Overview:**
We were asked to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election needed by the Colorado Board of Editors.

The Python script would need to deliver the following info:

1. Total number of votes cast
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Winner of the election based on popular vote
6. Voter turnout for each county
7. Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. County with the highest turnout
