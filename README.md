# Election_Analysis

## **Project Overview:**
We were asked to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election needed by the Colorado Board of Editors.

The Python script would need to deliver the following info:

1. Total number of votes cast
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Winner of the election based on popular vote
6. Voter turnout for each county
7. Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. County with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Summary: 

We can use the python script for additional information of any election provided that this info is collected as part of the original data file. Some examples are listed below:
* The political party of voters can be used to figure out which political party had the greatest voter turnout.
* The political party of candidates can be used to determine which political party received the most votes.
* The age of the voters can be used to identify which age range had the greatest voter turnout.
